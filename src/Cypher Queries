******* MATCH (Reading/Retrieving from dataset, more complex queries can be formed) *******

Fetch relationship via label type_of

1. Neo4j - MATCH (n)-[r:type_of]-() RETURN r, n;
- Neo4j stores type_of relationship type.

2. Memgraph - MATCH (n)-[r {label: "type_of"}]-() RETURN r, n;
- It stores type_of as label of relationship.

Fetch node and associated relationships with label TBox having node id 72

1. Neo4j - MATCH (n:TBox)-[r]->(b) WHERE (n.neo4jImportId = '72') RETURN r, n, b;
- here id of node is interpreted by neo4jImportId because dataset was loaded from a JSON.

2. Memgraph - MATCH (n:TBox)-[r]->(b) WHERE (n.id = '72') RETURN r, n, b;
- here id of node is stored normally as id property.

Fetch all TBox nodes

1. Neo4j - MATCH (n:TBox) RETURN n;
1. Memgraph - MATCH (n:TBox) RETURN n;

+++++++ CREATE (Create a node or relationship between two nodes) ******
